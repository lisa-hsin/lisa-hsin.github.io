<blockquote id="intro">As a cognitive scientist working on educational issues, I am interested in the cognitive and linguistic development of children from various sociocultural backgrounds, and how that development shapes their school-based learning. Primarily I focus on bilingual children&rsquo;s academic experiences and outcomes, given the distinctive profile of language and cognition that they present and, more practically, the pressing need for our nation&rsquo;s schools to encourage their academic development in light of that profile.</blockquote>

<h2 id="cognitive&mdash;linguistic&mdash;and-social-development-of-bilingual-children">Cognitive, linguistic, and social development of bilingual children</h2>

<p>Growing up bilingual in the United States is often associated with weaker academic outcomes, but on an array of strictly cognitive measures bilingual children meet or outperform their monolingual peers in early childhood and adolescence. My principal line of research, a collaboration with <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/faculty/catherine-snow">Catherine Snow</a>, uses student writing and experimental data to investigate the ways in which these cognitive advantages, particularly around theory of mind and social perspective-taking, may extend into the classroom, where bilingual children&rsquo;s high-level experience managing tools for communication in everyday life could compensate for deficits in lexical and syntactic development in the language of schooling.</p>

<h2 id="discussion-and-debate-based-academic-interventions">Discussion-and-debate-based academic interventions</h2>

<p>Educators place a high value on students' ability to articulate and defend an opinion they hold, as a criterion for effective participation in a democratic society &mdash; and recently developed curricula like <a href="http://wordgen.serpmedia.org">Word Generation</a> have shown that students benefit in a variety of ways from structured exposure to and engagement with discussion of contentious, topical issues. Together with <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/faculty/catherine-snow">Catherine Snow</a> I focus on outcomes for English learners within this particular curriculum, with a view toward developing further supports to be implemented in US classrooms.</p>

<h2 id="theoretical-accounts-of-grammar-representation-in-bilingualism">Integrated bilingual grammatical architecture</h2>

<p>Bilingual individuals easily switch between their two languages, and although even bilingual <em>children</em> seem to act as if there were a categorical separation in the mind between those two languages' rules and regularities, psycholinguistic and developmental data suggest otherwise. Focusing on evidence from Spanish-English bilingualism, I have argued for an <em>integrated</em> picture of bilingual grammatical architecture, documenting both facilitatory and interfering effects of acquiring two languages simultaneously. Currently I am working with <a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/jackendoff/index.html">Ray Jackendoff</a> on this issue from the perspective of the Parallel Architecture, having previously approached it in my dissertation using Optimality Theory with my graduate advisor, <a href="http://cogsci.jhu.edu/people/legendre.html">Géraldine Legendre</a>, after completing my  qualifying paper with <a href="http://lpad.johnshopkins.edu/cv_omaki.pdf">Akira Omaki</a>.</p>

<h2 id="task-effects-in-measurement-of-linguistic-development">Task effects in measurement of language development</h2>

<p>Data that inform theories of first-language acquisition tend to be drawn from corpora of spontaneous child speech or, more commonly today, from elicitation tasks and other psycholinguistic experimental methods. Often the conclusions drawn from such experiments neglect to take into account the possibility that children have a <em>conception</em> of the tasks which is not shared by adults, or that extralinguistic cognitive factors could interfere with linguistic performance. The <em>agreement</em> study <a href="#acquisition-of-agreement-in-typologically-varied-languages">below</a> affords us an opportunity to address these possibilities explicitly by shifting the focus to task effects, grappling with the relationship between what we see children doing &mdash; the data &mdash; and the way we build our understanding of it &mdash; the theory &mdash; for the purpose of developing clear and applicable interpretations of cognition from early childhood through young adulthood.</p>

<h2 id="acquisition-of-agreement-in-typologically-varied-languages">Acquisition of agreement in typologically varied languages</h2>

<p>The languages of the world realize subject-verb agreement in various ways, some of which are hypothesized to be harder to acquire than others. A diverse group of colleagues in the <a href="http://www.psychology.brookes.ac.uk/nayeli-gonzalez-gomez">United</a> <a href="http://jennifer-culbertson.github.io">Kingdom</a>, <a href="http://lpp.psycho.univ-paris5.fr/person.php?name=ThierryN">France</a>, and the <a href="http://cogsci.jhu.edu/people/legendre.html">United</a> <a href="https://liu-brooklyn.academia.edu/IsabelleBarriere">States</a> is conducting a systematic investigation of this piece of morphosyntactic development, toward the goal of identifying the linguistic features that contribute to earlier or later mastery of agreement, which could in turn enrich our understanding of developmental disorders and possible interventions.</p>
